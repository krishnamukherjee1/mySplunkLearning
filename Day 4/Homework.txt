Q1: Difference among "Fast Mode", "Smart Mode", and "Verbose Mode"
Splunk offers three search modes that balance performance and data richness:

Mode	Purpose	Field Discovery	Performance	Use Case
Fast Mode	Prioritize speed	❌ Off	⚡ Fast	Quick searches, dashboards, transforming commands
Smart Mode	Balance speed & completeness	✅ Adaptive	⚖️ Balanced	Default mode; adjusts based on search type
Verbose Mode	Maximize data visibility	✅ On	🐢 Slow	Deep analysis, troubleshooting, exploring unknown fields
Fast Mode: Only returns default/indexed fields and explicitly mentioned fields. No automatic field extraction.

Smart Mode: Behaves like Fast Mode for transforming searches (e.g., stats, chart) and like Verbose Mode for event searches.

Verbose Mode: Extracts all possible fields, including calculated and search-time fields. Useful for exploring unfamiliar data but slower2.

📊 Q2: Difference between | table and | fields
Both commands help control which fields appear in your results, but they serve different purposes:

Command	Functionality	Output Format	Performance	Use Case
`	fields`	Filters fields from events	Raw events	✅ Faster	Early field filtering, performance optimization
`	table`	Displays selected fields in tabular form	Tabular view	❌ Slower	Final presentation, dashboards, visual inspection
| fields removes unwanted fields early in the pipeline, reducing memory and bandwidth usage.

| table formats results into a table but is a transforming command, which can slow down searches if used mid-pipeline5.

⚡ Q3: Why | fields is faster than | table
| fields is a streaming command, meaning it processes each event as it comes and doesn't require all data to be collected first.

| table is a non-streaming transforming command, which means it waits for all events before formatting them, increasing load on the search head.

Using | fields early helps reduce data transfer from indexers to the search head, especially in clustered environments7.

If you're building dashboards or optimizing searches, knowing when to use each mode and command can make a huge difference in performance and clarity. Want to try a few SPL examples together?

🚀 Q1. Fast, Smart, and Verbose Modes in Splunk
Think of it like choosing how much detail you want when searching:
Fast Mode → “Just give me what I asked for — quickly.”
Smart Mode → “Give me extra details only if they help.”
Verbose Mode → “Give me everything, even the stuff I didn’t ask for.”
Fast is fastest, Smart is balanced, Verbose is most detailed but slowest.

📋 Q2. What's the difference between | fields and | table?
Imagine you're looking at a big form full of info, and you only want to see certain parts:
| fields → “Hide everything except what I need.”
| table → “Show me my selected info in a clean table.”
💡 fields keeps the raw format but just removes unwanted stuff. 💡 table makes it look pretty but takes longer.

⚡ Q3. Why is | fields faster than | table?
Because:
fields just filters info — it’s like saying “only bring me the essentials.”
table waits, organizes, and displays — like “let’s clean up and make it look nice.”
And honestly, cleaning up takes time, even for Splunk 😄
If you want, I can show you examples using SPL so you can see the difference in action. Just say the word!
Now give me examples
Of course, Krishna! Let’s walk through some real SPL examples so you can see how each concept works in action:

🔍 Q1. Examples of Fast, Smart, and Verbose Modes
Let’s say you’re searching for login failures:

spl
index=security sourcetype=access_combined status=401
Now try running this in each mode:

Fast Mode: Only shows basic fields like _time, host, source, sourcetype. You won’t see extra fields like user_agent or clientip unless you explicitly ask for them.

Smart Mode: If you add a transforming command like stats, it behaves like Fast Mode:

spl
index=security sourcetype=access_combined status=401 | stats count by clientip
If you remove stats, it behaves like Verbose Mode and shows all extracted fields.

Verbose Mode: Shows everything — even fields you didn’t ask for. Great for exploring unknown data, but slower.

📋 Q2. Examples of | fields vs | table
Let’s say you want to focus on login attempts:

spl
index=security sourcetype=access_combined status=401
Using | fields:

spl
... | fields clientip, user_agent
This keeps only clientip and user_agent in raw event view. No formatting.

Using | table:

spl
... | table clientip, user_agent
This shows results in a clean table — great for dashboards or reports.

⚡ Q3. Why | fields is faster than | table
Let’s compare two searches:

Using fields early:

spl
index=security sourcetype=access_combined status=401 | fields clientip, user_agent | stats count by clientip
✅ Fast: Filters fields early, reduces data sent to search head.

Using table mid-search:

spl
index=security sourcetype=access_combined status=401 | table clientip, user_agent | stats count by clientip
❌ Slower: table is a transforming command, so it waits for all events before formatting.
