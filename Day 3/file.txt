| eval aa="this is ayan01 and he lives in kolkata and his age is 29,this is subham88 and he lives in kolkata and his age is 24,this is abrar78 and he lives in vizak and his age is 35" , aa=split(aa,",") 
| mvexpand aa 
| eval age=mvindex(split(aa," "),-1) , name=mvindex(split(aa," "),2) 
| table age 
| search age>20 AND age<30

Solution:
1. 
| makeresults 
| fields - _time 
| eval aa="this is ayan01 and he lives in kolkata and his age is 29,this is subham88 and he lives in kolkata and his age is 24,this is abrar78 and he lives in vizak and his age is 35" 
| eval aa=split(aa,",") 
| mvexpand aa 
| eval age=tonumber(mvindex(split(aa," "),-1)), name=mvindex(split(aa," "),2) 
| where name="ayan01" 
| table name, age

2.
| makeresults 
| fields - _time 
| eval aa="this is ayan01 and he lives in kolkata and his age is 29,this is subham88 and he lives in kolkata and his age is 24,this is abrar78 and he lives in vizak and his age is 35" , aa=split(aa,",") 
| mvexpand aa 
| eval age=mvindex(split(aa," "),-1) , name=mvindex(split(aa," "),2) 
| table age 
| search age>20 AND age<30

# To remove the numeric part from the extracted name (e.g., convert "ayan01" to "ayan"), you can use rex or replace. Here's a clean version using replace to strip digits from the name field:
# Explanation:
raw_name holds values like ayan01.
replace(raw_name, "[0-9]+", "") removes all numeric characters, giving you just ayan.
where name="ayan" filters only that record.

| eval aa=split(aa,",")

4.
# display the name as Uppercase
# To display the name in uppercase, you can use the upper() function in SPL.
